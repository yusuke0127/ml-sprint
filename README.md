# Linear Regression

## Download the dataset

The dataset is available [here](https://wagon-public-datasets.s3.amazonaws.com/Machine%20Learning%20Datasets/NBA.csv).
You can load it into a DataFrame from your challenge notebook using only pandas :wink:


## The dataset 🏀

The dataset contains statistics of 4000 NBA players, including:

- `season`: The season (yearly) the player played in
- `poss`: Possessions played
- `mp`: Minutes played
- `do_ratio`: A player's ratio of time spent in defense vs. offense; negative values mean more defense positioning
- `pacing`: Player impact on team possessions per 48 minutes
- `win_rating`: *Wins Above Replacement* rating, how many additional wins a player is worth over a same-level replacement


## Exercise

In this exercise, you will model the relationship between the players' win rating and the amount of minutes they played.

Along the way, you will:

- Visualize the relationship between the win rating, minutes played, and other statistics
- Evaluate a Linear Regression model using K-Fold cross-validation
- Train a Linear Regression model
- Visualize the trained model
- Use the model to predict new data

## Let's go

To start the exercise, open `Linear_Regression.ipynb` in `jupyter notebook` and follow the instructions.

🚀 Your turn!
